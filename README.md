# NYUS.2.1_apple_grape
The NYUS.2.1.malus model is a mutated NYUS.2.1 that can be used for cold hardiness‚ùÑÔ∏è prediction for grapevineüçá and appleüçé.

The model will predict **LT25** (lethal low temperature that kills 25% of tissue) if choosing **'malus'** as the specie and an **apple** cultivar as the cultivar during feature extraction. The model will prediction **LT50** (lethal low temperature that kills 50% of tissue) if choosing **'vitis'** as the specie and a **grape** cultivar as the cultivar during feature extraction.
